<h2>WDV221 Intro Javascript</h2>
<h3>Project-6 Arrays - Code Examples</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each of the following use the teams array provided in the script of this page. </p>
<p>1. Display the array.</p>
<p>
  <script>
		document.write("Contents of the teams array: " + teams);
	</script>
</p>
<p>2. Display the first row of the array.</p>
<p>
  <script>
		document.write("Contents of row 0 of the teams array: " + teams[0]);
	</script>
</p>
<p>3. Use a for loop to write each row of the array out to this page. Each row should be in a paragraph.</p>
<p>
  <script>
		for(x=0;x<teams.length;x++)
		{
			document.write("<p>" + teams[x] + "</p>");
		}
	</script>
</p>
<p>4. Use a while loop to write each row of the array out to this page. Each row should be in a paragraph.</p>
<p>
  <script>
		var loopControl = 0;		//declare and create the loop control variable
		while(loopControl <teams.length)
		{
			document.write("<p>" + teams[loopControl] + "</p>");
			loopControl++;								//update the loop control variable inside the body of the loop
		}
	</script>
</p>
<p>5. Use a loop to write out each row of the array as list items within the following list.</p>
<ul>
List of Team Names
<p>
	<script>
		for(x=0;x<teams.length;x++)
		{
			document.write("<li>" + teams[x] + "</li>");
		}
	</script>
</p>
</ul>

<p>8. Create a function called displayTeams( ). It will use a loop to write out the Team name and score in the same paragraph.</p>
<script>

	displayTeams();		//this function is called during run time so that it can do document.write commands without screwing up the page.

</script>

<p>9. Write a loop that will add 3 to each value in the scores array. Run the displayTeams( ) function again to display the updated scores. </p>
<script>

	updateScores();		//this function will add 3 to each score in the scores[] array.
	displayTeams();		//this function is called during run time so that it can do document.write commands without screwing up the page.

</script>
<p>10. Write a function that will search the team array for a given name. If it finds the name it will display the team's score. If not a message &quot;Team is not listed' will be displayed. This is called a lookup array.  Once the right row is located for them go to the scores array and get the corresponding score for the selected team.</p>
<form name="form1" method="post" action="">
  <p>
    <label>Team Name: 
      <input type="text" name="inputTeam" id="inputTeam">
    </label>
  </p>  
  <p>
    <input type="button" value="Find Score" onClick="lookupScore()" /> Score: <span id="teamScore"></span>
  </p>

</form>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</body>
