<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<p>Please complete the following exercises using Javascript loops as indicated.  Please place your code on this page. Use runtime scripts unless told otherwise. </p>
<p>1. Create a WHILE loop that will print out the  numbers 0 to 4 each on a seperate line.</p>

	<script>
	//1. a while loop that starts at 0 and adds 1 until it gets to be less than or equal to 4
		let x=0
		while(x<=4)
		{document.write("<p>" + x + "</p>");
		x++;}
	</script>

<p>2. Create a FOR loop that will print out the  numbers 4 to 0 each on a seperate line.</p>

	<script>
	//2. a for loop that starts at 4 and subtracts 1 until it get to be greater than or equal to 0
		for(i=4;i>=0;i--)
		{document.write("<p>" + i + "</p>");}
	</script>

<p>3. Create a loop that will print 1 to 5 each in its own paragraph element.</p>

	<script>
	//3. a for loop that starts at 1 and adds 1 until it gets to be greater than or equal to 5
		for(f=1;f<=5;f++)
		{document.write("<p>" + f + "</p>");}
	</script>

<p>4. Create a loop that will print out the following numbers (5,10,15,20,25...) until one is greater than 40.</p>

	<script>
	//4. a while loop that starts at 5 and adds 5 until it gets to be greater than or equal to 45
		let d=5
		while(d<=45)
		{document.write("<p>" + d + "</p>");
		d=d+5;}
	</script>

<p>5. Create a loop that will print out  6 of the following messages (Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, etc. ) as options within the drop down menu below.</p>


<p>
  <label>Select an Option! 
    <select name="select" id="select">
    	<option>
    		<script>
   			 //a while loop that starts at 1 and adds 1 until it gets to be greater than or equal to 6
				let c=1
				while(c<=6)
				{document.write("<option>" + "Option " + c + "</option>");
				c++;}
			</script>
		</option>
	</select>
  </label>
